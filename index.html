We are an interdisciplinary research group, using computational and molecular techniques
to carry out basic and applied research related to biology. 

A major activity has been working as part of the open source community on projects such as
the InterMine data integration platform.


Current interests include:
 - antimicrobial resistance
 - synthetic biology
 - large-scale data integration [<a href="http://intermine.org/">InterMine</a>, <a href="https://www.humanmine.org">HumanMine</a>, <a href="https://www.flymine.org">FlyMine</a>]
 - machine learning related to the above [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34531510">Polyglotter_21</a>, SQLformer, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16540">SFAVEL_23</a>]
